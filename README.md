# MCP Bridge - VS Code Setup Wizard (binary distribution)

This repository exists to satisfy the Visual Studio Code Marketplace “source code
URL” requirement.  
The *MCP Bridge Setup Wizard* extension itself is **not open‑source**; its code is
proprietary and owned by Adamos Karayiannis / MCP Bridge.

The repo therefore contains only:

* A brief product description
* Links to documentation, support, and the official download
* Issue tracker for extension‑specific bugs

---

## What the extension does

* Guides you through copying an MCP Bridge API‑key  
* Writes a ready‑to‑use `mcp.json` configuration  
* Generates / opens pre‑filled `.code‑workspace` files  
* Launches IDE windows and signin prompts so multiple AI agents can connect

For full platform details and setup steps, visit **<https://mcpbridge.dev/setup>**.
